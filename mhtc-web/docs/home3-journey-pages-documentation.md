# Home3 Journey Pages Documentation

This document outlines the structure and content for the Home3 journey pages:
- Pre-Arrival
- Arrival
- Treatment
- Post-Treatment

These pages will complement the main `home3/page.tsx` and provide a distinct user experience compared to `home2` journey pages. They will utilize components from `mhtc-web/components/home3/` where appropriate and introduce new components as needed, maintaining the `home3` design language which emphasizes interactivity, modern aesthetics, and potentially animations.

## Common Elements for All Home3 Journey Pages

- **Header**: Use `Header` from `@/components/home3/header`.
- **Footer**: Use `Footer` from `@/components/home3/footer`.
- **Navigation**: A new `Home3JourneyNavigation` component will be created. It will visually align with `home3`'s aesthetic (minimalist, modern, possibly animated transitions). It should clearly indicate the current stage and allow navigation to other stages. This component will be similar in purpose to `Home2JourneyNavigation` but styled for `home3`.
- **Container**: Use `Container` from `@/components/home3/ui/container` for consistent layout and spacing.
- **Responsive Design**: All sections must be fully responsive, adapting gracefully to various screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Adherence to WCAG AA guidelines is paramount.
- **Internationalization**: Content will be structured to facilitate easy translation and adaptation for different locales.
- **Visual Style**: Clean, spacious, with high-quality imagery and iconography consistent with `home3/page.tsx`. Focus on user experience with intuitive interactions.
